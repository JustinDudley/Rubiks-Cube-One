''' Rubik's Cube Turn Notation (36 symbols; 54 when double turns (eg. R2) are included):
R  L  U  D  F  B
R' L' U' D' F' B'
r  l  u  d  f  b
r' l' u' d' f' b'
   M     E  S 
   M'    E' S'
X     Y     Z
X'    Y'    Z'

also:  R2   u2    Y2  etc.   Note: R'2 is probably always printed R2  '''

Ee Python style guides.  

Near the top of the doc is a docstring (short for documentation string).  It is enclosed in triple quotes.
Depending on the location of a triple-quoted comment, sometimes the comment is not entirely hidden, but accessible in some way by 
the programs that read code.  So it really MATTERS how you you style your triple-quoted docstrings'''
